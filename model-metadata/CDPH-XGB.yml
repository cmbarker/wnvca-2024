  "Two predictors were trained upon the data. The first one is a binary classifier to detect if any cases are present, 
  and returns the probabilities of P(C=0) and P(C>0). The second classifier assesses the probability of cases being in any of the non-zero 
  classification bins and returns a vector of probabilities P(C=bin). Finally, we evaluate both predictors on each data point and retrieve the full 
  distribution with: P(C=0), P(C>0)*P(C=bin)."
